      // But for SOME reason, lunar client throws about 200 lines of errors whenever you join a match
      // So if the timing isn't perfect, it doesn't detect "...sending you to..." at all.
      // Often the timing is perfect, I'd say roughly 95% of the time it has worked for me, but it's not 100% reliable.
