## Features

### <b>NOTE: HypixelStats is only currently compatible with Lunar Client. Support for other clients coming soon!</b>

- Automatically detects when you join new game, sends /who to get the full list, and automatically detects when players leave/join and adds/removes them from the list.
    - Auto `/who` requires Java to be installed.
- Fully configuarable view of stats, with on-the-fly profile switching for easy viewing of any stats you want, at any time.
    - Also includes assignable colors based off of stats, as well as the ability to sort the list by any (numeric) stat.
- Includes the ability to whitelist/blacklist players for quick identification. By default, whitelisted players appear green and blacklisted players appear red. (This is configurable in the profiles!)
- Detects nicked players and displays them as yellow by default (also configurable).
- Keeps track of every player you've run into since you opened the app (single-session), for ease of blacklisting or whitelisting players you've recently played with.
- Built-in plancke.io search

## Features in the works

- Compatibility with vanilla client
    - Won't be adding compatiblity with BLC as I don't support the devs, use lunar or vanilla.
- Automatic, temporary party whitelisting (toggable)
- Keybinds for switching profiles and switching into a possible lobby-view mode.
- Support for custom APIs
    - Default one at hypixelstats.com with reports for a sniper/cheater detection network maybe?
- Single stat next to name
- Reach goal: make into an overlay, similar to BedwarsStats overlay.

To be clearâ€”I have nothing against the BedwarsStats overlay, and I'm not trying to cut into its success! I greatly respect the developer and all the hard work he has put in, especially regarding the sniper detection network. While this program is very similar, it has come out of a need for a cross-platform solution, because BedwarsStats is windows-only. Open-source is also a plus.

If you only have a single monitor, BedwarsStats is still superior. If you have two+ monitors, it's your choice of which one is easier to read and gives more relevent information. 


## Installing, Getting Set Up, and Updating

### Installing
- Go to the latest release (on the right side of this page).
- If you're on windows, download `HypixelStats.exe` and run it.
    - Your antivirus will probably throw a fit. It's fine, just ignore the warnings and continue. You can look at and compile the code yourself if you don't trust me (hey, I get it).
    - Complete the installer.
    - The installer should automatically create a Desktop Icon. You can run the program from there.
- If you're on linux, use the `.AppImage` and you're done.
- If you're on MAC, good luck. Run it with node.

### Setup

1. To get started, get your hypixel key. You can do this just by joining hypixel and doing `/api key`. Then, go to `Settings -> Application Settings`, and put it in.
    - Any time you switch to an alt account, make sure to do `/api new` and it will ***automatically*** detect it and set it for you. (You don't even have to be on the Settings page! It'll pick it up anywhere). It can break things if you don't do this.

2. You will also need to set your log path. Open the lunar client launcher, go to the "about" tab, and click "open logs folder in file explorer." Here you should see a `renderer.log` file. Make sure to give the <b>FULL</b> path to this file, e.g. `C:\Users\me\.lunarclient\logs\renderer.log`

3. Once your log location is set, close the app entirely and start it again. (I know, it's a bit annoying, but you only have to do this once.)

Done!

You can now join a game and see all the stats! (If you don't have Java installed, you'll have to do `/who` manually. I'd recommend installing Java and restarting the application.)

***NOTE***: If you ever play nicked, make sure to go to the Aliases tab and set your nickname! It can break things if you don't.

### Updates

When a new update is available, you'll see a prompt in the top right of the dashboard to update. Click it, and you're done! It's that easy.

## Disclaimer

This is my first time using node, electron, and a bunch of other web-like technologies. I'm completely self-teaching and just trying to build something that <i>works</i>, so maybe the best practices aren't always used. If you notice something off, feel free to submit an issue! I'm always willing to learn where I went wrong and what the better way to do it is.
